#Desalination and Salt Objects

An important part of our work is how to desalinate the water after it dissolves the salt so that when it is circulated back through the pump the salt doesn't collect and block the flow and ruin everything. It’s a bit of challenge to turn dirty water to clean water, which is the case in a lot of the world already. If only Lockheed Martin would hook us up with their fancy new Perforene, set to save the world: 
[Perforene](http://gizmodo.com/5990876/lockheeds-new-carbon-filter-takes-all-the-effort-out-of-desalinization). 

It's weird to see how closely the future of clean water and the $857 billion dollar F35 fighter jet programs are.

Basically it's really difficult to filter water from salt because the two molecules are so small and close in size (relatively speaking).

##Approaches
1. Humidifier

 At first we thought we could use a simple humidifier. I found this great video explaining how they worked: [Supersonic Humidifier](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlWkkujeBww). 

 It seemed perfect, basically a supersonic vaporization of water that would allow us to separate the water from the salt. Just kidding. Because it does not vaporize the water, it atomizes it. Which means that since its not being heated and turned into water vapor proper. It's just tiny droplets of water, not an actual gas. If it were that easy we would have solved the world's water desalination problems, I guess. In the end, we still may test it out to see if it at least decreases the salt content to a point that will not destroy the pump.

2. Evaporation
 
 For now we're back to the classic “save-yourself-on-a-desert-island” method. Heat the water under the hot Bermuda Triangle Sun, put a slanted surface above it thats a bit colder, it condenses, and drips down into a clean water tank.

3. Conclusion

 In a less than ironic way, this aspect of our project highlights some of our interests in the material aspect of our work, how water is this thing that seems so easy and present and willing to be manipulated but really its so delicate, and not simply replenishable or "filtered" into perfection. Well until Lockheed Martin came along that is.

##Salt objects

On the subject of salt, here are some salt objects we're going to be using for our next prototype.

These are made from basic table salt that is finely ground and made into a paste with water, formed, and then baked or sun dried to harden. After that they're sanded down into a desired structure. We have also been experimenting with additives including clay powder and soywax to slow down the dissolution process.
