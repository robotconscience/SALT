#Cloud

As noted in our [API post](https://github.com/robotconscience/devart-template/blob/master/project_posts/2014-03-14-APIs.md), we are using [Spacebrew](http://docs.spacebrew.cc) and [Temboo](https://temboo.com/) to interface with Google and Twitter APIs. 

One of the great things about Spacebrew is that we developed it, like nodejs, to be runnable locally for high-performance installations and to be able to be deployed to the cloud via services like Amazon's EC2 and Google's Compute Engine. Spacebrew uses [WebSockets](http://www.websocket.org/) to facilitate all communication, making it ideal for connecting apps like our SALT output (in openFrameworks) to web-based services (e.g. our APIs and GCE over the internet). 

We set up our own Spacebrew server on GCE (do people call it that?) to let us test over the internet and keep our installation mobile. Below is a step-by-step guide how we did it!

##Setting Up Spacebrew on Google Compute Engine
* First, download the [Google Cloud SDK](https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/gcutil/) for your platform
	* This allows you to connect to and configure your cloud instance.
	* As you install, you will be given a range of choices.
		* Where: install it somewhere you'll remember
		* Send feedback to Google? Up to you!
		* Languages: unless you're using Google App Engine as well, you can type '4' at this menu
		* For the rest of the options, use the defaults and type "Y" (aka "yes!")
		* Restart your Terminal
* Open the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project)
* Create a new project, or click on an old one (if you've made one within the last 6 months or so)
* Click "Compute Engine" on the right
	* If you haven't enabled billing on your account, you will now: enter your CC info, etc
* Create a new virtual machine by clicking "New Instance"
	* Make a meaningful name, description, and tags
	* Location and Resources
		* Select a zone based on where you live...
		* For the "image", select a linux-based image. We're using backports-debian
		* For "machine type", we'll select "g1-small". Spacebrew does not take a lot of computing power or memory, so even a standard instance is a bit of overkill.
			* IF you want to do more high-performance stuff on this server, pick a machine type that better fits your usage!
	* Network
		* Make sure to create a new static IP address. Give it a meaningful name as well!
	* Keep everything else at the defaults!
	* Click "Create". Now we're cooking!
* Opening Ports
	* We need to open ports to allow Spacebrew to connect to the outside world!
* Finishing Setup
	* We now need to set up a firewall to allow incoming/outgoing Spacebrew connections
		* Open Terminal
		* Log in to your Google Account:
		```
		$gcloud auth login
		```

		* Follow the on-screen steps, then return to Terminal
		* Enter the ID of your project for ease-of-use
			* It's at the top of the "overview" page 
		* Add HTTP and Spacebrew ports to a new Firewall
		
		```
		gcutil addfirewall spacebrew-port --allowed :80 --allowed :8080 --allowed :9000
		```

* Setting up Spacebrew
	* On your instances's page (first opened right after you clicked "create" or accessible via "VM instances" in your sidebar, click "SSH" under "Connect"
	* Copy the command
	* Open Terminal and paste the command. It should look something like this:
	
	```
	$gcutil --service_version="v1" --project="ID OF YOUR PROJECT" ssh  --zone="WHAT ZONE YOU ARE IN" "NAME OF CLOUD COMPUTE INSTANCE"
	```

	* Install everything we need to run/install Spacebrew
	```
	$sudo apt-get install git
	$sudo apt-get install python g++ make checkinstall
	$src=$(mktemp -d) && cd $src
	$wget -N http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz
	$tar xzvf node-latest.tar.gz && cd node-v*
	$./configure
	$fakeroot checkinstall -y --install=no --pkgversion $(echo $(pwd) | sed -n -re's/.+node-v(.+)$/\1/p') make -j$(($(nproc)+1)) install
	$sudo dpkg -i node_*
	$cd ~
	```
	
	* This will take a little bit, and should require all of the packages you need for both node and git
	* Clone Spacebrew from Github, then install dependencies
	
	```
	$git clone https://github.com/Spacebrew/spacebrew.git
	$cd spacebrew
	$npm install forever-monitor
	$npm install ws
	```

	* Ok, we're good to run!
* Running Spacebrew
	* We're going to use the [screen](http://aperiodic.net/screen/quick_reference) command to run Spacebrew in its own process
	* We need to install screen first, then at any point we can attach and deattach to these processes. Quick quide:
		* Create a new screen OR reattach to an existing screen (if one of this name exists)
		```
		$screen -R NAME_OF_SCREEN
		```
		* Detach from screen (once we're in)
			* CONTROL+a then CONTROL+d
	```
	$sudo apt-get screen
	$screen -R spacebrew
	(hit "enter" once "NEW SCREEN" comes up)
	$cd spacebrew
	(ONLY do this if you're not already in the spacebrew folder)
	$node node_server_forever.js
	```
	* then type CONTROL+a then CONTROL+d to detach
* Trying it out
	* Now that we're all set up, you can test your Spacebrew connection. The easiest way to do so is open up one of the Javascript examples and the Admin
		* Slider: [http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew.js/spacebrew_slider/index.html?server=YOUR_IP_HERE](http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew.js/spacebrew_slider/index.html?server=YOUR_IP_HERE)
		* Admin: [http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=YOUR_IP_HERE](http://spacebrew.github.io/spacebrew/admin/admin.html?server=YOUR_IP_HERE)
		* For both, your IP is the Static IP you set up above!

##Now what?
* Now that we have our Cloud Compute Spacebrew server set up, we can connect all of the Spacebrew apps we are running to our server! These include:
	* [API apps](https://github.com/robotconscience/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/APIs)
	* [SALT display](https://github.com/robotconscience/devart-template/tree/master/project_code/openFrameworks/SALT/SALT)
	* [TSPS](https://github.com/labatrockwell/openTSPS)
