#Context & References


Brett and I have been looking at and discussing a lot of 20th century art while working on our installation. Gustav Metzger's Auto-Destructive works have become a point of conversation for us conceptually. Looking to his various Manifestos, there are certainly differences in what we're interested in. Where Metzger was concerned about war and industrialization as active acts of destruction, places you can point to, we're more interested in the latent acts of energy consumption and human habits that are rapidly altering future possibilites for ecology in a broader sense. Anyway, here's Metzger:

At the same time, Zach Gage's work has always been floating through our heads, especially "temporary.cc", a website that irreparably deletes itself with each visitor. It's gone now. It's been gone for several years now, because we all wanted to see it and see what was happening. I think this project really hits the notes we're also learning how to play.

And then there's Janine Antoni. Her interest in how performance or really any action can be mapped and translated into another thing, has been an important part of how we think about how events can be experienced through another interface, in a way that might not be obvious or direct. Her works like "Lick and Lather" where the process is so embedded in the object and the change is made so readily apparent is very important to how we think about larger scaled objects and how we can interface those things through the smaller, or at least differently scaled world we usually live in. Perhaps its futile, but it is a way into something so large like water desalination or the amount of electricity that it takes to power all the bits of servers that allow twitter to continue its existence. In her work *Tear* a wrecking ball is cast out of a softer lead and used to tear down a building, but by being of this softer material it becomes marked and changed by its act of destruction. I don't know that Janine Antoni would speak to my reading of this work, but I certainly think that in some way that wrecking ball "knows" that house in a way we simply cannot, and in a very counter intuitive way, I get something very new and special from seeing the wrecking ball's experience of the house. ![Tear](http://calcdn.artcat.com/images/exhibits/9971_1252032428.original.jpeg)

And last, the conceptual space we derive much of our thoughts is that of Object Oriented Ontology and aspects of the broader field of Speculative Realism. Timothy Morton's writings on his own concept of **hyperobjects** is just consuming our way of thinking about scale and interface, and perhaps even the futility of a project like ours. Moreover, the relationship to how we as people think about our interaction with large-scale objects like Climate or Twitter, and how these things are in and around and on everything we do, is very important to us. We want to envision ways to "look" at (might be better to say "be with") those things that don't seem immediately present but completely are just in a way that doesn't hit our human senses of sound and vision and smell and touch and ESP (that last one applies just to me, I have a extra senses that you don't and it's awesome).
