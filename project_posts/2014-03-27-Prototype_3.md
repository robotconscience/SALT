#Prototype 3

After the promising results from our second prototype, we immediately headed back to the studio to work on version 2.5.

Based on our 2nd prototype, we made our planned refinements:
* We ceiling mounted our projector
* Enclosed our armature to prevent water splashing
* Ceiling mounted web camera for tracking presence in the installation
* Added the YouTube API (alongside the Google+ API) as an interactive source for the water ouput
* And most excitingly, we attached a servo motor and pulley system to the water output to alter its location and more evenly dissolve the salt.

## Water distribution

As you may have noticed in our last prototype, we ended up with a very even distribution of water across our sculpture. Thus, the end result was simply a large hole, rather than an evenly dissolved piece.

We have always planned a larger array of pumps in the final piece, but our prototype demonstrated we need to make them move as well! Inspired by the simple mechanisms found in inkjet printers and the like, we decided to create a small track for one of our outputs (the one tied to visitors' presence) to slowly move from left to right. 

## Servo system

To create our track, we first attempted to build a mechanism with a single servo. As you can see in the gif below, a) I don't know much about mechanisms and b) a normal servo was not going to give us the range we needed.

In order to get a longer track, we decided to build a pulley system with a continuous servo. They can be a little tricker to control, but would give us flexibility as far as the size of our track.

* [Smooth belt](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12458)

With some leftover wood from our frame, Shobun and I whipped together a simple rig:

## Setting Up: Mounting the projector

Once we'd built our new armature, we had to complete our physical set up. As mentioned above, mission number 1 was to ceiling mount our projector. Luckily, our studio has a massive wood beam; coupled with this [fantastic projector mount from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Projector-Vaulted-22-4-Inch-Extension/dp/B000TUDOQ8/), we were good to go.

## Setting Up: Calibrating

Now that we had the projector and Kinect on the same plane, we could finally calibrate them with the process described in our [second post](https://github.com/robotconscience/devart-template/blob/master/project_posts/2014-03-06-Calibration.md).

## Setting Up: Mounting the Pulley Rig

We built a tiny frame for our servo rig, and attached it to our favorite wood beam as well. We then attached our pump tubing with a less-than-beautiful system of zip ties, a small counterweight, and tape (hey, it's a prototype!).

## Setting Up: Second Camera + Lighting

We mounted a second camera (just a PS3 eye web camera for now) to our rig and hung a single light to help out our documentation.

Very technical rigging...

Computer setup: 
* Machine 1: 
	* SALT app (openFrameworks) 
		--> Kinect
		--> Arduino
		--> Projector
	* Google+ API (nodeJS)
	* YouTube API (nodeJS)
* Machine 2:
	* TSPS 
* Compute Engine (in the cloud)
	* Spacebrew server (nodeJS)
		* All apps are connected to Spacebrew server

Finally, we fired up our openFrameworks and node apps. The calibration came out great; with a little tweaking, our Kinect mesh lined up perfectly with our salt object.

## Conclusion / Next Steps

We'ved learned a lot from our prototypes, and in approaching our gallery-ready piece we have a pretty clear path to completion. Our next big design hurdle will be creating sound for the piece, which will be produced via Ableton Live. We find the piece as it stands doesn't challenge the user to question their interaction. Building a visceral sound environment will force visitors to attend to the moment they enter the piece's field of vision.
