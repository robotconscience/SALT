## Description
SALT is a physical, digital, and sonic sculpture that is gradually destroyed by direct and indirect human interaction, with the goal of making global-scale ecological concerns compelling and accessible to a wide audience.â€¨

The sculpture is centered around a single salt-based sculpture that slowly dissolves at a rate controlled by the physical presence of visitors at the installation, as well as virtual influences coming from a range of data harvested from online activity.

Live programatic visuals will be directly mapped onto the salt object as it dissolves and will be accompanied by multi-channel audio output. The visual and audio elements will degrade as a direct result of the salt dissolving, creating a visceral connection between the physical and the digital.

### Salt Sculptures
The sculptural elements of the salt installation are built using basic non-iodized table salt and small amounts of soy wax. The salt is ground into a fine powder, and then heated with water and a small amount of soy wax, forming a paste. The paste is rapidly formed into small unit blocks, then cooled and dried at room temperature. These smaller units are used to form the larger structures used for the installation, bound by another salt paste mixture. Once these final objects have dried, they are sanded into their final shapes.
