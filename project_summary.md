(tentative Title)

## Description
SALT is a physical, digital, and sonic sculpture that is gradually destroyed by direct and indirect human interaction, with the goal of making global-scale ecological concerns compelling and accessible to a wide audience.â€¨

The sculpture is centered around a single salt-based sculpture that slowly dissolves at a rate controlled by the physical presence of visitors at the installation, as well as virtual influences coming from a range of data harvested from online activity.

Live programatic visuals will be directly mapped onto the salt object as it dissolves and will be accompanied by multi-channel audio output. The visual and audio elements will degrade as a direct result of the salt dissolving, creating a visceral connection between the physical and the digital.
